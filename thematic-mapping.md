### Cartograms / map morphing

The topics around map morphing can be related to the development of [ScapeToad](https://github.com/christiankaiser/scapetoad).

- **Visual cues** for cartograms / map morphing. How to increase the effect of cartograms? Can we introduce some visual cues to help the user read the map? ScapeToad has a _deformation grid_ which has been added for this purpose. Are there other possibilities?

- **Map morphing** for navigation. Can map morphing increase the usability of interactive navigation maps (for pedestrians, cars etc.)?
